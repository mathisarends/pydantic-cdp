    Issued when the domain is enabled and the request URL matches the specified filter.
    The request is paused until the client responds with one of continueRequest,
    failRequest or fulfillRequest. The stage of the request can be determined by
    presence of responseErrorReason and responseStatusCode -- the request is at the
    response stage if either of these fields is present and in the request stage
    otherwise. Redirect responses and subsequent requests are reported similarly to
    regular responses and requests. Redirect responses may be distinguished by the value
    of `responseStatusCode` (which is one of 301, 302, 303, 307, 308) along with
    presence of the `location` header. Requests resulting from a redirect will have
    `redirectedRequestId` field set.
